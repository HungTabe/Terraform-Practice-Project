Here’s a **final report** summarizing your Terraform practice project, adapted to your needs for **learning, collaboration, and public accessibility**:

## **Final Report: Terraform Practice Project**

### **Project Title**

**DevQ-Inspired AWS Infrastructure Practice with Terraform & LocalStack**

***

### **Objectives**

*   Learn Terraform through hands-on AWS infrastructure deployment.
*   Simulate AWS services locally using **LocalStack** for cost-free testing.
*   Make the project **publicly accessible** for others to review and collaborate.
*   Provide **live endpoints** and a **static site** for visibility.
*   Enable **CI/CD** and **remote state management** for team collaboration.

***

### **Architecture Overview**

Minimal AWS stack inspired by DevQ architecture:

*   **API Gateway + Lambda**: Public HTTP endpoint for health checks and mock data retrieval.
*   **DynamoDB**: Stores simple review items.
*   **S3 Static Website**: Hosts documentation and artifacts.
*   **CloudWatch**: Logs for Lambda and API Gateway.
*   **IAM Roles**: Least privilege for Lambda and API Gateway.
*   **Remote State**: S3 + DynamoDB or Terraform Cloud for collaboration.

***

### **Key Features**

1.  **Public Access**
    *   API endpoint: `GET /health` and `GET /reviews/{id}`
    *   Static site: Hosted on S3 with public read access.
2.  **Local Development**
    *   LocalStack for simulating AWS services.
    *   Docker Compose for easy setup.
3.  **Collaboration**
    *   Public GitHub repository with README, architecture diagram, and contribution guidelines.
    *   Issues and Pull Requests enabled.
4.  **CI/CD**
    *   GitHub Actions for `terraform fmt`, `validate`, and `plan`.
    *   OIDC-based AWS authentication for secure automation.
5.  **Security**
    *   No secrets in repo; use GitHub Secrets and AWS Secrets Manager.

### **Deployment Options**

*   **Local**: Run with LocalStack for free testing.
*   **AWS**: Deploy to your AWS account for public access.
*   **Remote State**: Use S3 + DynamoDB or Terraform Cloud for collaboration.

### **How Others Can Access Your Work**

1.  **GitHub Repository**
    *   Push your project to a **public GitHub repo**.
    *   Include:
        *   README with setup instructions.
        *   Public API and static site URLs.
        *   Contribution guidelines.
2.  **Public Endpoints**
    *   Share API Gateway URL and S3 website link in README.
3.  **CI/CD Transparency**
    *   Enable GitHub Actions to show Terraform plan results on PRs.

***

### **Next Steps**

*   Create a **GitHub repo** and push the project scaffold.
*   Deploy the minimal AWS stack so you have **live URLs** to share.
*   Add reviewers and invite contributions.

***

✅ I can now **generate the full project scaffold (Terraform code, Lambda, LocalStack setup, CI/CD workflows, README)** for you in a downloadable ZIP file or as code blocks you can copy.

**Do you want me to:**

*   **Prepare the full scaffold now** (with all files)?
*   Or **write a step-by-step guide** for you to set it up manually?
